# Netflix-Clone
A full-stack web application that resembles Netflix, developed using React, Nodejs, Context API, MongoDB and Firebase.

## Features of the Netflix-Clone App (for regular users):
- User authentication and authorization using JWT.
- Option to choose the type of content - either movie or web series.
- Filtering the movies/shows based on the genre.
- On clicking a particular movie/series, the trailer of the same will play on full screen. For this project, I have used
Firebase as a data store for storing all the movie trailers and images and Mongo DB as the database that will store
all the information about the movies/series and the users.

## Admin (Developed as a separate application):
- The admin can log in to the admin dashboard using his credentials.
- Can view the details of all the movies/series that can be viewed by the users in the Netflix clone app.
- The interface allows the admin to add new movies/series by accepting the movie details along with the
images and trailer of the movie/ series, and delete some existing movie, series or user.
- Can graphically view the number of users joining every month.
